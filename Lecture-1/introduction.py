what is python :  =>  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
=> It was created by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991.

why python is .. ?
(1) interpriter : it is exicute line by line by an interpriter.

(2) object-oriented : using class and object:- In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
class : a class is a blueprint for creating objects 
object : and an object is an instance of a class.

Syntax class :

class ClassName:
    # Constructor (optional)
    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):
        self.attribute1 = parameter1
        self.attribute2 = parameter2
   
    def method_name(self):
        return f"Attribute1: {self.attribute1}, Attribute2: {self.attribute2}"


(3) High-Level Language :  meaning it is designed to be human-readable, Python allows developers to write complex programs without managing memory manually

(4) dynamic symantic :  You donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable.

*** Features of Python :

Easy to read : Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers.

High-leval :  High-level language means human readable code.

Compile and interpriter :  Python code first gets compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted line by line.

Standard Library : Python comes with several standard libraries that provide ready-to-use modules and functions for various tasks, ranging from web development and data manipulation to machine learning and networking.

Open-spurce :  Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language.
